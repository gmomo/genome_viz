## Canadian Centre for Computational Genomics - GsoC 2019 Proposal

### Project Info

#### Human history and data visualization
The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use python pipeline to produce such data visualizations from genomic data. The data needs to be dimensionally reduced to 2/3 dimensions using either PCA,UMAP,t-SNE or a combination of the above to generate insightful visualizations.

### Student Bio

I am currently a Masters Student in AI at NUS. I developed a visualization dashboard using Bokeh and Python as part of GSoC 2017 for EMPA. I was a Visiting Researcher at ISI, Kolkata where I worked on predicting Cancer Survival Rates using Machine Learning Models on Molecular and Protien expression data of patients. I have industry exposure in Big Data while working for dDriven. I was responsible for creating an entire processing engine on top of Apache Spark.

### Method 

#### Goal
The goal of this project is to have an interactive application in the web-browser which enables the end-user to upload genomic data files of his/her choice, clean or extract relevant information, perform dimension reduction techniques ( PCA.t-SNE,UMAP or a combination) and plot the respective graphs. Addtionally, the user must be able to save the graphs and point coordinates to the local machine along with a log file containing all the parameters of the experiment.

#### Challenges 
1. The data can be of varied formats - VCF Files, Population panel files, TSV, CSV or FASTA Files.
2. The processing steps may be varied and numerous, combining varioud files from user input. 
3. Genomic data is typically quite large ( 100000 * 100000) or more. Thus, data processing and visualization will take significant time.
